                            Detailed Review:

                            As I was nearing my wedding in the end of Jan 2024, I and my fiance wanted to have a
                            pre-wedding shoot. We had approached several vendors and Kumarsphoto stood out from all.
                            Right from the day I spoke with Kumar, I knew I had to approach Kumarsphoto for my
                            pre-wedding shoot. On the first call he took his time to explain to me all things I had
                            to
                            consider for the shoot: timings, attires, locations/studios...etc even before he had
                            spoke
                            anything about the pricing details. His passion for the work, made me feel confident in
                            his
                            teams ability to deliver on the promise of a stellar job.

                            Up until the day of the shoot, I had approached and called Kumarsphoto several times to
                            clarify my doubts and ask for various suggestions for the pre-wedding shoot and Kumar
                            has
                            always picked up my call, responded cordially and accommodated all my requests. I wanted
                            to
                            mention this specifically because, as a customer the customer service experience was
                            excellent. Kumarsphoto also had sent me reminders before the pre-wedding shoot to get
                            myself
                            prepared for the day.

                            On the day of the shoot (December 17th) the team had arrived at Charminar (one of our
                            outdoor locations) at 6am, and had patiently stayed until my fiance and I arrived at
                            7am. As
                            we had begun our pre-wedding shoot, the team was very friendly and kept the mood light
                            and
                            humours, this made us feel comfortable with the shoot pretty much immediately and had
                            good
                            laughs which helped us keep our faces smiling throughout the whole day for the shoot.
                            And if
                            you have ever had a Pre-wedding shoot you know how tiring it is to keep smiling all day
                            long
                            and pose for the photos / videos.

                            Kumarsphoto and I had discussed having one outdoor and one indoor studio shoot. On the
                            day
                            of the shoot, I was thoroughly surprised when the team had asked us to go to another
                            outdoor
                            location Mansa Hills, right after our Charminar outdoor shoot. This was a welcome
                            surprise
                            for us.

                            The team was very friendly and professional, they had suggested creative poses for the
                            shoot, and were always on time throughout the day for the various locations we had
                            choosen
                            for the shoot. The shoot had begun since morning 6am and concluded in the evening at
                            9:30pm,
                            which is about 13+ hours of work day, throughout the shoot the team was energetic and
                            humours and kept us going up until late in the evening. Pretty happy with the service we
                            had
                            got so far. Their team is commendable and myself & fiance were appreciative of the job
                            they
                            had done on the day of the shoot.

                            Now we were eager to see the output and had requested Kumarsphoto to share us the end
                            result
                            sooner as our wedding was approaching end of Jan 2024. Kumarsphoto had delivered on the
                            promise of giving us the output within 3-4weeks. Infact they had shared the output
                            within 2
                            weeks (on December 27th) timeframe. Kumarsphoto had shared all the edited photos, videos
                            and
                            raw content.

                            We are super happy and satisfied with the end result. Their output says it all about
                            their
                            quality of work. All my family and friends were in awe of the videos and photos created
                            by
                            Kumarsphoto. Their hardwork and quality stands out, when you see the amount of raw
                            footage
                            the team had shot on the day of the shoot and the effort they had to put to go through
                            all
                            of the raw footage, select photos and videos clips and create the teaser videos and
                            edited
                            photos. We had shared couple of songs for our teaser video and the team had selected and
                            edited the video clips to match and sync with the song lyrics. Stellar job!!!

                            I recommend everyone, including my family and friends to approach Kumar for a wedding or
                            any
                            event photography/videography.

                            Especially if you are getting married, I would surely recommend you to get a pre-wedding
                            shoot, the whole shoot will be an experience to remember and the output will bring you
                            closer with your fiance 🙂

                            I can't express enough gratitude to Shushil and his incredible team for making our
                            pre-wedding shoot an absolute dream come true. From the moment we met, their passion and
                            dedication to capturing love through the lens shone brightly.

                            we had begun our pre-wedding shoot, the team was very friendly and kept the mood light
                            and
                            humours, this made us feel comfortable with the shoot pretty much immediately and had
                            good
                            laughs which helped us keep our faces smiling throughout the whole day for the shoot.
                            And if
                            you have ever had a Pre-wedding shoot you know how tiring it is to keep smiling all day
                            long
                            and pose for the photos / videos.

                            Kumarsphoto and I had discussed having one outdoor and one indoor studio shoot. On the
                            day
                            of the shoot, I was thoroughly surprised when the team had asked us to go to another
                            outdoor
                            location Mansa Hills, right after our Charminar outdoor shoot. This was a welcome
                            surprise
                            for us.

                            The team was very friendly and professional, they had suggested creative poses for the
                            shoot, and were always on time throughout the day for the various locations we had
                            choosen
                            for the shoot. The shoot had begun since morning 6am and concluded in the evening at
                            9:30pm,
                            which is about 13+ hours of work day, throughout the shoot the team was energetic and
                            humours and kept us going up until late in the evening. Pretty happy with the service we
                            had
                            got so far. Their team is commendable and myself & fiance were appreciative of the job
                            they
                            had done on the day of the shoot.

                            Now we were eager to see the output and had requested Kumarsphoto to share us the end
                            result
                            sooner as our wedding was approaching end of Jan 2024. Kumarsphoto had delivered on the
                            promise of giving us the output within 3-4weeks. Infact they had shared the output
                            within 2
                            weeks (on December 27th) timeframe. Kumarsphoto had shared all the edited photos, videos
                            and
                            raw content.

                            We are super happy and satisfied with the end result. Their output says it all about
                            their
                            quality of work. All my family and friends were in awe of the videos and photos created
                            by
                            Kumarsphoto. Their hardwork and quality stands out, when you see the amount of raw
                            footage
                            the team had shot on the day of the shoot and the effort they had to put to go through
                            all
                            of the raw footage, select photos and videos clips and create the teaser videos and
                            edited
                            photos. We had shared couple of songs for our teaser video and the team had selected and
                            edited the video clips to match and sync with the song lyrics. Stellar job!!!

                            I recommend everyone, including my family and friends to approach Kumar for a wedding or
                            any
                            event photography/videography.

                            Especially if you are getting married, I would surely recommend you to get a pre-wedding
                            shoot, the whole shoot will be an experience to remember and the output will bring you
                            closer with your fiance 🙂

                            is so pleased. Everyone liked their work which prompted me to share this review. I think

                            Took their service for my wedding reception, must say that Shushil and his team have
                            been
                            super diligent and professional in my experience. The waitjng time post the event was
                            minimum which was a refreshing thing to experience for such events (Disclaimer: Mine was

                            deliver
                            on their promise)

                            Like these guys are great! They did my wedding photography back in December and their
                            work
                            is so pleased. Everyone liked their work which prompted me to share this review. I think
                            they are very reasonable about their fees and the quality of work is good. Would
                            recommend
                            them for anyone for sure.

                            We had found Kumar's work via an Instagram profile, at first we were hesitate to work

                            we didn't know him personally but his work looked great, so decided to talk to him for
                            our
                            pre- wedding photoshoot.
                            I was actually surprised to see how genuine of a person he is, fast forward today, we
                            had
                            some of the best moments captured in his camera. My wife loved pictures so much she
                            still
                            flaunts them everywhere.
                            If you're looking to work with him and having second thoughts, I will just say your
                            moments
                            are in safe hands.

                            It was really wonderful to meet the team, they were more like a family rather than a
                            team.
                            They made us feel like home and they have lot of patience. If I would just want to
                            describe
                            the team in one line they are a team of complete package. We get love, family and what

                            I am really impressed by their work, their dedication to the work and their patience. We
                            might not get across these kind of people in our life but I have met these wonderful
                            people
                            who are really awesome and I am out of words to describe the team. If I would have my
                            friends or my relatives I would love to suggest them this team for sure and this team
                            should
                            be reach their heights. I would pray to God that this team will grow more and more so
                            that
                            they will be an inspiration, support to each and every one. Thank you team and I really
                            love
                            you guys.

                            might not get across these kind of people in our life but I have met these wonderful
                            people

                            should
                            be reach their heights. I would pray to God that this team will grow more and more so
                            that
                            they will be an inspiration, support to each and every one. Thank you team and I really
                            love

                            Kumarsphoto is one of such photographers who charge you less and exceed your
                            expectations.
                            I am really glad they we have gone for Kumarsphoto instead of going for really expensive
                            one

                            I came across Sushil's profile on wedmegood but was hesitant to choose someone just over
                            the
                            reviews but when I met him and listened to his ideas, I was confident enough to select
                            him.
                            I was really impressed with their punctuality, hardwork and patience.. Sushil was very

                            I came across Sushil's profile on wedmegood but was hesitant to choose someone just over
                            the
                            reviews but when I met him and listened to his ideas, I was confident enough to select
                            him.
                            I was really impressed with their punctuality, hardwork and patience.. Sushil was very
                            cooperative, solved all my queries and helpful in many issues. I thank him for all the
                            beautiful pictures and videos..

                            I came across Sushil's profile on wedmegood and took his services. I can say he is a
                            person
                            with both talent and patience. Right from invitation video to wedding
                            photography album design, he patiently accomodated all our requirements and gave us the
                            best
                            product. It is a real fun working with his other team members. I highly recommend his

                            We came across Sushil's name in a Real Weddings Blog on Wedmegood.com, We fall in love
                            with
                            the wedding photos in his sample albums, as it shows the actual stories throughout the
                            wedding and it is so classic that you will appreciate the photos in years to come!
                            We were so impressed and sent him an inquiry. We were very delighted when he visited my
                            house to discuss more about the wedding and showcase the albums.
                            Without even securing a booking, he was giving us all sorts of advice for the big day,
                            little tips that we never would have thought of otherwise.
                            We met with a few other photographers, but he was the clear choice as soon as we met him
                            &
                            we hired him for our wedding.
                            Sushil & his team literally worked non-stop for the 12 hours or so he was working. Many
                            guests commented how dedicated our photographer was & All my family and friends have
                            commented on how amazing our photos are. As a result of his hard work, our photos are
                            amazing.
                            Thank you so much Sushil for your time, efforts and spectacular work!!
                            The work you did for our wedding was just wonderful!!! We cannot thank you enough for
